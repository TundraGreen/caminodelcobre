        The Camino is still in its early phase of development.  In the future it will extend from the northern barrancas with their scenic waterfalls, along the canyon rims, and ultimately to the deep canyons and the intensely Tarahumara culture of the south.  At this time, however, the Camino is focused in the tourist center of Creel.
      text_2: |
        The principal station on the famous Chihuahua Pacific ("Chepe") railroad line through the Copper Canyon region, Creel is in the middle of the entire Barrancas del Cobre area.  It offers good access to explore both north and south from the rim to the High Country.  It has well-developed facilities and experienced individuals to provide outstanding recreation in biking, horseback riding, adventuring, hiking, 4 wheelers, and guided touring.  For this reason the initial section of the Camino starts in Creel with the final destination of the famous vistas of Divisadero.   In later years additional sections will be gradually added to the Camino to complete its long-distance vision.

        The Camino is intended to be enjoyed in many ways.  Some visitors may want to undertake a single long continuous effort while others may prefer to experience it by means of a series of smaller excursions.  As of 2015 the initial parts begin in Creel and extend toward the rim vistas of ​Divisadero in segments of varying lengths, depending on the hiker’s preference and ability.  The first segments go 25 kilometers via the trail (20 kilometers via the Creel-Divisadero highway) toward the barrancas near Divisadero.  With a number of convenient places to stop and return to Creel by vehicle (or the Chepe train), the trail offers a good opportunity to enjoy the High Country pine forest with views of the distant barrancas.

  guide:
    intro: |
      The following trail guide is designed to enable hikers to complete a ~25 kilometer (16 miles) hike connecting Creel and the Barranca del Cobre rim at Divisadero.  It currently stops at the crossing of the paved highway (Mexico 77) with the railroad ~20 kilometers south via the highway.  There are other shorter segments possible as well.

        1. The guide is written from the perspective of a hiker leaving the train station in Creel traveling south.  However, the trail itself is designed to accommodate hikers walking in the northward direction (e.g., toward Creel) as well.  Trail markers are intentionally visible from both directions.  However, the Guide takes off from Creel as the center of tourism for the region and the primary terminus for the Chepe tourist train.  Hikers traveling north should be able to follow the path “in reverse:” e.g., “turn left” becomes “turn right,” “after the fork” becomes “before the fork,” etc.

    overview: |
      The Camino del Cobre (The Copper Canyon Trail) will be a long-distance trail that highlights the tourist wonders of the Copper Canyon region - nature, culture, history, and the opportunity for personal challenge.  Extending from the northern waterfalls to great southern canyons, the Trail will follow the rim of the world's largest canyon system - with chances to visit local villages and historical sites. When completed, the Trail will span a number of days in  its entirety.  Now hikers can follow the trail markers for their own route of 1,2 or more days, starting in the eco-tourist center of Creel, Chihuahua, Mexico.
    participation:
      text: |
        The Camino del Cobre is still in the very early stages of its development.  It still faces many challenges. It will benefit significantly from the participation of any individual or organization committed to the benefit of the Copper Canyon and the Tarahumara people and willing to devote their energy to helping build the trail and its impact in the region.

        Visitors thinking of walking the Camino del Cobre may want to consider taking the Chihuahua Pacific Train to Creel and then on to the Copper Canyon itself.  The train is one of the most well-known tourist experiences in Mexico, famous for its tunnels, bridges, and impressive canyon vistas.  Because of its initials in Spanish (“CH” and “P”), it is often known as “El Chepe.”   
        
      text_02: |
        Every day the train makes a 650 kilometer (400 mile) journey between Chihuahua City and Los Mochis on the Mexican Pacific coast.  In its western half the journey travels right through the Copper Canyon country (including the Barranca del Cobre itself).  It makes a special stop to view the Barranca at Divisadero and another stop at the tourist center of Creel (45 kilometers, or 25 miles away).  
        
      text_03: |
        Passengers have the choice of two different classes of service.  While there is an economical service oriented toward local residents, many of the passengers on the Chepe train are tourists, both Mexican and foreign.  Because the Camino del Cobre starts right at the train station in Creel, it may be a good transportation option for Camino hikers.

      text_01: |
        The Camino region is a rugged and relatively less explored area. The detail trail and topographic maps often purchased for use in other countries are not available.
      text_02: |
        However, for an overall perspective, hikers may want to buy a topographic and road map of the area south of Creel. It omits the final 2 kilometers into Creel itself but provides valuable information for the remaining 95% of the Camino . The map is a product of the Mexican geographical service called INEGI (for its initials in Spanish). The section depicted is titled San Jose de Guacayvo with the ID number G13A21.
      text_03: |
        The map is good for giving an overview of the relief of the area (arroyos, summits, and the like). However, its information about trails, roads, power lines, and houses is in many cases out of date or unreliable. It is for sale in various shops in Creel.

    outfitters:
      text_01: |
        The Camino del Cobre is designed for all types of visitors: those who are comfortable with hiking on their own, as well those who prefer to use the services of guides or outfitters who can assist in the logistics of hiking in the outdoors of Copper Canyon (food, tents, etc.).  These companies may also be able to provide transportation to hiking locations or simply knowledgeable advice on hiking opportunities.
      text_02: |
        As a developed tourist area, Creel offers a number of experienced and well-qualified outfitters.  They offer a wide variety of services and recreation opportunities, including hiking, mountain biking, adventuring, or simple sightseeing coach tours.  For a list compiled by a well-known newspaper, click below.  Or search the Internet.
      text_03: |
        In many cases these companies may be contacted via the Internet, making it unnecessary to come to Creel to arrange for their services.

    security:
      text_01: |
        The safety and security of visitors to Copper Canyon country is an issue for many people thinking about enjoying the region’s attractions.  Over the years there have been many media stories about violence and crime in Mexico.  Many of these incidents are based on conflicts over drugs and the “cartels” that participate in drugs.  Other stories deal with less serious crimes such as pick-pocketing or robberies in Mexico’s cities where visitors are victimized while seeing the country’s well-known tourist sites.
      text_02: |
        Fortunately, the Copper Canyon region is very far from the drug or urban areas that generate the vast majority of such stories.  It is 260 kilometers (160 miles) from Chihuahua, the nearest large city, and another 240 kilometers (150 miles) to the closest border station with the US (Ojinaga) where drugs are more common.  While transportation for tourists is good, criminals do not have fast and easy access to the area.  
      text_03: |
        As stated by the U.S. Department of State in its 2015 travel advisory for Mexico, “Resort areas and tourist destinations in Mexico generally do not see the levels of drug-related violence and crime that are reported in the border region or in areas along major trafficking routes.”  (Dated May 5, 2015).
      text_04: |
        There are other reasons why Copper Canyon is seen as safe for visitors.  As a rural area surrounded by forests and nature where people live a more traditional way of life, the region is free from many of the social problems in the crowded cities or border areas.  In addition, as a tourist area, there is strong concern by law enforcement and other government agencies and local businesses to maintain a safe environment.  More importantly, local people recognize that a safety and security are important to maintain the health of tourism and help to control criminal activity.  
      text_05: |
        For more information about crime and safety in Mexico , click below or search the Internet.
        
      text_06: |
        Of course, no area anywhere in Mexico or in any country can be guaranteed to be completely safe.  Accidents and crime can happen anywhere without warning.  As a result, visitors thinking about walking the Camino del Cobre should take the usual precautions when in an unfamiliar area or situation.  There is significant advice available on the Internet about these simple security measures in any country or rural situation.  For more information, click below or search the Internet
      text_07: |
        However, visitors to the Copper Canyon and the Camino should be particularly aware of a few simple rules especially relevant to the region:
      text_08: |
        1. Tell someone (at your hotel, outfitter, or tourist office) of your general plans for traveling or hiking (where and when you will go).  Copper Canyon country is large.  Not many people live there.  If an emergency should arise, then the authorities or rescue parties can know where to look for you.
      text_09: |
        2. Seek advice from local residents if there are any areas or times where there might be a crime concern.  
      text_10: |
        3. Be friendly and open with local residents – whether Tarahumara or other - you may meet on the Camino.  Don’t approach them with a threatening or suspicious manner.  In most cases they will be just as friendly and open in return.

        The Camino is for hikers who want to enjoy walking outdoors. However, in practical terms, many hikers may want to spend some portion of a day hiking and the rest of the day at some other recreational activity. Therefore, the Camino is designed to be experienced in discrete, and somewhat independent, segments (similar to Trails in other countries). At convenient points along the Camino the hiker can leave the trail, walk ~50 meters to a junction with Highway 77, and return to Creel via some form of motor transportation. Alternatively, the hiker may take a vehicle from Creel to an access point, and return to town walking on the Camino.
      text_02: |
        The most convenient vehicle transport is with one of the many transportation companies in Creel. In many cases it is possible to arrange direct transport either to or from an access point for a reasonable cost.
      text_03: |
        Alternatively, some hikers may prefer to use buses. Bus transportation is a very common throughout Mexico. The Creel and entire Barrancas region has a well-developed system of bus transportation. There are many buses that regularly travel along the main Creel-to-Divisadero highway. Using buses for some portion of a day’s hiking is feasible.
      text_04: |
        There are 3 leading bus companies that serve the highway: Rápidos Cauhtémoc,,its affiliate Transportes Chihuahuenses, and Noroeste. Their offices and departure points are located in Creel on the same road as the train station (on the west side of the tracks). Between Creel and San Rafael (a village just south of Divisadero) their official stops along the highway are in the pueblos of Santa Elena, San Elias, and Pitorreal. In several locations there are also permanent bus stop structures along the highway such as at the rancho of Nacayvo.
      text_05: |
        However, as is common in Mexico, bus drivers will stop and let passengers off anywhere on the route they want (subject to a safe and convenient location). Similarly, bus drivers will stop to pick up passengers who “flag them down” anywhere on the highway (also in safe locations).
      text_06: |
        Bus costs from Creel (2015) range from 20 pesos (the pueblos closest to Creel) to 50 pesos (Divisadero).
      text_07: |
        Rapidos and Chihuahuenses run every 2 hours from 8:30 a.m. until 18:30. Noreste has buses every 4 hours starting at 10:30

    trail_markers:
      text_01: |
        The Camino is indicated by simple green and red trail markers roughly 5 X 10 centimeters (2 X 4 inches) painted primarily on trees or rocks. The markers are generally horizontal bars. In certain situations the markers are also found on telephone poles, fence posts, concrete walls, buildings, even the concrete ties of the railroad – anywhere they are easily visible and helpful to the hiker who doesn’t know the route.
      text_02: |
        The markers are generally 30 - 40 meters apart. In cases where the trail is difficult to follow, or very important, the markers are more frequent – sometimes as close as 5 meters or less. On some paths that are easy to follow (for example, a long straight road with no intersecting paths), the markers are farther apart. Their purpose is primarily to provide reassurance that the hiker is indeed on the correct path.
      text_03: |
        From one marker it should be possible to see the next marker along the trail. If not immediately visible, hikers should walk forward following their previous direction (e.g., straight) while looking for the next marker on nearby trees or rocks. It should be visible within 15 meters.
      text_04: |
        In addition to the principal markers showing the correct path, the Camino also shows a large red “X” on trails that are NOT correct. These are typically found at intersections where there might be some uncertainty about which path to take.
      text_05: |
        Moreover, to show where there are turns or gentler “bends” in the path, the trail markers show the oncoming turn, either sharply or in a gradual “Y” curve.

    weather:
      text_01: |
        Due to the wide range of elevations in Copper Canyon country (up to 1500 meters [5000 feet] of altitude difference), there is a wide variety of weather and climatic conditions.  In general, the canyon bottoms will be up to 10+ degrees Celsius (~20 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer or hotter than the rim.  For example, in the summer when the temperature at the rim at Creel can be warm, the temperatures In the canyon bottom (such as Batopilas or Urique) can be very hot (up to 40 degrees Celsius or 100 degrees Fahrenheit).
      text_02: |
        In general, the canyon rims where most visitors will want to will have a moderate climate similar to areas of equivalent altitude in the Southwestern U.S. (New Mexico and Arizona) or southern Europe.  Summer months will be warm to hot (30 Celsius or 85 Fahrenheit.  Spring and fall will be pleasant at 15 to 20 degrees Celsius (60 to 70 Fahrenheit, and winters can occasionally be cold.  Freezing temperatures are occasionally experienced at night from December to February while days typically warm above freezing.
      text_03: |
        The Copper Canyon region of Mexico experiences a summer rain pattern.  That is, it rains frequently between the months of June and August with lesser amounts in May and September.  Often these rains will be intense but brief, a pattern sometimes called “tropical monsoon.”   As a result of this atmospheric moisture in summer, the canyon bottoms can be very humid in addition to high temperature.  In other times of year, precipitation (rain or snow) is infrequent.  
      text_04: |
        Most visitors find that the weather is best for visiting the Copper Canyon in the spring, summer, or autumn.  The winter is too cold for many.

    high_country:
      text_1: |
        The High Country region between Creel and the rim (Divisadero) is generally rugged, rolling terrain lying between 2,100 to 2,400 meters (roughly 7000 and 8000 feet) in elevation.  In many cases the terrain is that of a ”mesa” (Spanish for “table”) and quite flat for many kilometers.  However, there are also many arroyos (small canyons carved by water) cutting across the mesa.  However, the elevation change between the top of the mesa and the bottom is generally less than 200 meters.
      text_2: |
        Close to Creel views are primarily those of forested ridges and arroyos.  Further south, the vistas widen out to the barrancas and river canyons.
      text_3: |
        The region is well forested primarily with Ponderosa pine.  There are also stands of coniferous cedars and junipers and deciduous trees such as oak and madrone (a low, distinctively red-barked tree).  However, despite the presence of the many water courses, there is little water on the surface except during the rainy season.
      title: |
        The High Country
    route:
      text_1: |
        Due to the rugged and undeveloped terrain of the Creel region, the Camino generally follows the Chepe railroad route southward toward Divisadero.  By its nature, the railroad cannot climb or descend rapidly.  Its tracks are limited to a 3% grade.  This route enables hikers generally to avoid steep elevation changes associated with simply going cross-country on a direct line.  Instead, the Camino follows a gently rolling, often flat path, despite the rough country around it.
      text_2: |
        In addition, the trail also follows the modern Creel-to-Divisadero highway (Mexico 77).  This paved highway often is also very close to the railroad line.  In many areas the Camino path is very close to either the highway or the tracks (as close as 5 meters).   In most cases hikers are within easy hearing range of highway vehicles or the trains.  However, at no time, does the Camino trail overlap directly with either the highway or the tracks.  In limited cases, of course, the trail separates at greater distance from the two modern routes (up to several kilometers in the El Cajón canyon area).
      text_3: |
        In certain locations, the Camino also follows the course of pipelines carrying water and natural gas between Creel and certain rim villages (Divisadero, Arepanoguchi, San Rafael).  The pipeline course is also close to the highway (primarily) and railroad tracks.  These sections are somewhat more “up and down” than those nearer the railroad.  However, the pipelines also tend to avoid the extremely steep changes possible in such rugged country.
      text_4: |
        By taking advantage of these existing routes, the Camino generally offers comfortable walking in rolling terrain without the extra-rigorous demands of a high-altitude (2000+ m) hike.  In addition to this physical aspect, the proximity of the road (and railroad) offers hikers the security of knowing that there are alternative ways to return to developed areas, if they want to stop or if they face a medical or other emergency.

        The Route
    tarahumara:
      text_01: |
        One of the most enjoyable aspects of exploring the Copper Canyon region is the opportunity to encounter the Tarahumara people, often also called the Rarámuri.  They are one of Mexico’s native or indigenous tribes and lived in the Sierra Madre for centuries.  There are approximately 100,000 Tarahumara living in Copper Canyon area from north of Creel extending south toward the town of Guachochi.  Due to their relative isolation and poor communication infrastructure, many still speak their indigenous language in the home (in addition to Spanish used in schools and commerce).
      text_02: |
        Many Tarahumara have moved to the towns of the region (such as Creel), where they can be seen on the streets, in the shops, and on the plazas.  In many cases, particularly for the Tarahumara women, they continue to wear their traditional dress, often skirts and shawls of bright colors.  
      text_03: |
        While some Tarahumara still believe in their traditional religious practices, many now belong to the Catholic Church.  Many villages have small churches to serve their members, including some built as missions 300 years ago (for example, in the largely Tarahumara town of Sisoguichi 20 kilometers north of Creel).  
      text_04: |
        Over the years, modern Mexican life has increasingly affected the Tarahumara.  Nonetheless, the majority of Tarahumara still live a more traditional life style on the land.  They often have small homes in the forest and tend their fields (primarily corn or maize) or livestock, often using simple farming methods such as horse-drawn plows.  
      text_05: |
        The Tarahumara are famous for their running ability.  In fact, according to some, the name Rarámuri refers to running on foot.  Living at high altitudes (over 2000 meters, or 7000 feet) gives them the advantage of well-developed lung capacity.  In addition, due to the long distances to cover between their homes, farms, and villages, there has been a long tradition of running between villages, often traveling many kilometers over the rock terrain barefoot.
      text_06: |
        A significant amount of information about the Tarahumara is available online.  For more information, click below or search the Internet.

      Region and route
    trail:
      text_1: |
        The Tarahumara living the Barrancas are historically well-known for their tireless walking and running.  As a result there have always been many forest paths that cover the Creel-to-Divisadero region connecting ranchos, roads, fields, and pueblos.   In addition, as Mexico has developed in recent years, there is also an extensive network of rough rural roads for motor vehicles (typically 4 wheel pickups) used by the locals for longer trips.  Close to Creel itself, there are also designated hiking, biking, and ATV trails, occasionally marked with arrow or other trail markers.
      text_2: |
        The Camino largely takes advantage of previous paths and roads used by the Tarahumara and other local residents.  It often goes by farm fields and isolated houses.  It often selects the paths best suited for hikers, rather than just for more practical purpose (such as choosing a more scenic path, rather than the most direct).  Depending on what is available in any specific area, the Camino uses rural roads, narrow single-track paths through the woods, the wide open course of pipelines, ATV or mountain bike tracks, and an occasional cross country “bush whack” with clear markers on trees.   It then connects these disparate paths into an overall path connecting important points on the way.  The hiker could easily start on a wide rural road, transition to a narrow path through the trees for a short time, then switch to a pipeline course, and back to a forest path.

        There is a great diversity of wildlife in the greater Copper Canyon area.  Due to the significant elevation range from the rim of the canyon (2400 meters, or 8000 ft) to the bottom of the canyons (550 meters, or 1800 feet), there is a wide diversity of habitat and environment for both plants and animals.  In the hot and arid canyon depths the desert species of plants and animals thrive – cactus, lizards, snakes, and the like.  
      text_02: |
        However, in the cooler areas in the Sierra Madre mountain mammals are more similar to “temperate zone” wildlife familiar in the U.S. or Europe – such as deer (white-tailed) , black bear, small rodents like squirrels, rabbits, and even the puma (mountain lion).  However, due to hunting over the many years of human habitation, the numbers of these larger mammals is limited.
      text_03: |
        The best opportunity for wildlife viewing is birdlife.  Roughly 300 species of birds live in the region.  24 of these species are limited just to the Copper Canyon area, including the military macaw and the thick-billed parrot.  For more tropical species, an excursion – either on foot or by coach - to the lower parts of the canyons  may be necessary.

        The trail heads south (in the direction marked toward Los Mochis indicated on the train station), starting immediately after leaving the station (27.75438, 107.634893, elevation 2340 m),
      text_02: |
        A green and red trail marker is painted on the rock wall opposite the station across the tracks. There is similar green and red trail signage painted on the wall going south from the station and later on posts and buildings through the rail yard.  There is a concrete sidewalk on the east side of the tracks for 200 meters from the station past the central plaza.
      text_03: |
        After the town center, several unpaved paths run parallel to the main tracks.  The most suitable trail varies from one side of the tracks to another, and hikers can choose their preferred path.  The tracks themselves also vary between single tracks and double tracks for 300 meters until a “rail yard” widens out with multiple tracks, returning to a single track at ~600 meters.
      text_04: |
        ~750 meters south of the station, the trail bends to the west (right) and passes under a white highway bridge for the principal highway into Creel (Mexico 77). (27.743488, 107.643543, elevation 2340 m).
      text_05: |
        It continues another 300 meters along a road that parallels the railroad tracks with houses and small shops.  It then crosses the tracks next to the large rocks of the mesa and bends left along the tracks as they make a large turn to the left (south).  For ~100 meters the trail is 5 meters below the tracks.  Midway along the turn of the tracks the trail turns hard right (west) along an unpaved rural road.  On the right are farms fields and pastures with houses several hundred meters from the trail. The trail is on the south side of a flat farming valley ~1 km long.  (The Lion Caves (Cuevas de los Leones) is on the north side along a side road,) ~150 meters after the right turn the trail forks left (crossing a small waters course) and climbs gradually on the south side past more rural homes.  
        
      text_06: |
        As of 2015, there is an unfinished adobe house on the right side of the trail as it begins its climb on the left. (27.742904, 107.647314, elevation 2340 m).
      text_07: |
        After ~100 meters the trail enters the trees as it climbs to the top of the mesa above Creel.  There are views to the right (north) over the valley and mesas.  Following a series of forest paths and switchbacks the trail reaches the top of the mesa after 20 minutes.  The trail emerges from the trees to turn right (west northwest) onto a rural road that runs above the rural valley.  The trail is generally flat with trees on the right above the escarpment and mixed fields and trees on the left.  The trail passes through open woods terrain with trail markers on trees, rocks in the road, and on large boulders next to the road.   The direction is generally west northwest.  In this section there are many rural roads and smaller paths in all directions.  Attention to stay on the right trail may be necessary.
      text_08: |
        After ~1.5 km in open forest the trail turns more to the west and enters denser woodlands, sometimes following fence lines enclosing farm fields on the left.  ~3 km from Creel (40 minutes), after crossing a small water course, the trail turns sharply to the west.  It follows rural roads and fence lines with farm fields (sometimes with farm houses and animals and local Tarahumara farmers) on the left.
      text_09: |
        In this section there are also many small paths and roads that cross or run parallel to the trail.  After ~1 kms the trail turns hard to the right from a road onto a forest path that descends gradually and crosses another small water course. It climbs gradually through open forest until it meets a farm field on the left and follows the fence line until turning left (again along fence line) for 200 meters.
      text_10: |
        On the right large rock formations and a bare gravel pit are visible 100+ meters from the trail. There are many cris-crossing paths in this area. The pit is ~3.5 kms from Creel via the trail.  On the far (west) side of the pit (~200 meters from the trail) is the old road from Creel to Divisadero.  Hikers wanting to return to Creel have the option of crossing the pit, turning right on the old road, and walking back to town.
      text_11: |
        Midway along the fence line the trail bends slightly to the right into the trees (remaining to the east of the gravel pit).  It descends slightly into a water course, rising on the other side to pass through a rural gate and 20 meters beyond into a large field at its northwest corner. The trail passes 100 meters in the west side if the field next to dense woods on the right.  A second mesa climbs steeply in the right. At the southwest corner it passes through another rural gate and turns sharply right (west).  After ~100 meters the trails climbs steeply (~40 meter gain in 400 meters) to the top of the second mesa.  The area is heavily forested in pine with madrone (red barked broad-leaf tree).  After reaching the top of the mesa the trail bends gently to the right until reaching the old road from Creel to Divisadero (unpaved and rough).
      text_12: |
        Hikers wanting to return to Creel at this point can turn right onto the old road and walk along it for ~5 kms.  However, the Camino turns left at this junction and continues to

        This section takes hikers from the Creel train station into the forest outside of town.  After passing through a residential area to the south, it separates from the railroad tracks and climbs into the forest on the mesas surrounding the town.  Once on the mesa, it passes through a mixture of farm fields and forest, sometimes on a rural road and sometimes on a single-track forest path.  After a second climb up another mesa, it ends at the old road between Creel and Divisadero ~4 km from Creel.

        The trail starts at the intersection of the trail and the old unpaved road to Divisadero. The trail turns sharply left onto a side road that runs parallel 5 meters east (left) of the old road. The trail markers follow the fence posts for ~50 meters until reaching a barbed wire gate on the left.
      text_02: |
        The trail turns sharply left (east) through the gate onto a road leading past several Tarahumara houses on right (and left farther away).  It follows the road (not entering the driveways to the farm dwellings) passing the fence of a small field on the right.  At the end of the fence it turns sharp right, then quickly sharp left.  In 75 meters the trail goes through another pole gate.
      text_03: |
        From the gate the trail follows a rural road skirting a low hill on the left for ~ 1.0 km through the pine forest. There are occasional side roads to the right leading away from the hill (for example, ~1/2 km past the gate).  ~750 meters past the gate the forest opens up with fewer trees and more low brush and bushes.  The trail bends right off the road to a single track path. Close attention to the trail markers posted on trees and on rocks in the road may be necessary,
      text_04: |
        ~1.25 km the trail passes into high open brush land with views of Creel on the left.  It curves gently to the right (south and then west) and descends slightly (5 - 10 meters) until meeting a trail coming from the left.  From this intersection the railroad line is visible directly in front ~ 20 meters.  The trail bends right and follows a defined single track trail through the trees gradually getting closer to the railroad tracks.  In ~100 meters the paved highway to Divisadero also becomes visible on the left 15 meters on the other side of the tracks.  At this point the trail is very close to both the tracks and the road.  The turn-off to the new Creel airport is on the opposite side of the highway.  For hikers wanting to return to Creel it is possible to cross the tracks at this Point, turn left (north and down the hill) onto the highway, and follow it ~3 kms to town.
      text_05: |
        The trail continues from this point on a defined single track parallel to the tracks.  It gradually climbs into the forest (somewhat to the right) increasing its distance from the tracks (up to 50 meters).  ~200 meters from the possible track crossing the trail leaves the trees and crosses a small rocky area with the trail indicated on the rocks.  It resumes its course west through the pine forest.  In some areas the single track path is also marked with "blazes" (small areas on the tree where the bark has been removed).
      text_06: |
        After ~1 km the trail bends left and crosses the railroad tracks.  It then bends slightly right and descends in 75 meters to a small parking area on the west side of the highway,  The railroad continues higher on the slope and further away from the trail.  Hikers wanting to return to Creel can turn left on the highway (north and up the hill) at this point (~3.5 kms to town via the highway).
      text_07: |
        The trail directly crosses the parking area (20 meters), following markers painted on rocks in the open area.  It follows a rough rural road and descends slightly through the trees crossing a small water course.  The road / trail climbs slightly through the trees alongside a field and fence.  On the left an open area of scattered bushes and low trees is visible beneath the turn of the highway (< 50 meters away).   ~30 meters from the water course the trail turns sharply left away from the fence onto a defined single track path through more scattered low bushes.  It curves to the left back toward the road through trees.  After ~75 meters the trail meets the highway but turns sharply right on a defined path ascending away from the road.  In ~75 meters the trail crosses the railroad tracks (which has once again rejoined the trail) and again enters into the pine forest.
      text_08: |
        From this crossing the trail continues south-south west parallel to the tracks (generally visible and <50 meters) on the left. The highway is also running parallel on the other side of the tracks (another ~25 meters away).  The path is generally flat or gently rolling as it crosses a small water course.  In some cases trees also have "blazes" aa well as Camino markers.  In some areas the vegetation is manzanita or other low brush.  In ~1 km the trail again approaches closer to the tracks and passes through broken trees and brush.
      text_09: |
        The trail emerges from the low forest and crosses the old unpaved road from Creel to Divisadero.  In another ~20 meters the old road also crosses the railroad tracks (complete with an X-type railroad crossing sign) and meets the modern paved highway.  This crossing and junction is easily visible from the trail on the left.  Hikers wanting to return to Creel may turn left at the crossing onto the road and return (~4.5 kms via the highway).
      text_10: |
        This crossing is a network of roads leading to various destinations in the area.  Care to follow the Camino markers (often on rocks) may be necessary.  After crossing the old road the trail descends on a short rural road slightly for ~15 meters to a 4-way junction with a rural road crossing the Camino. The Camino is the straight alternative (e.g., parallel with the tracks) descending to a small water course.  From this point the trail generally follows a rural road that runs parallel to the tracks (~20 meters to the left) for ~1 km to the end of the section.  It is generally open and free from vegetation.  The pine forest is on the right.
      text_11: |
        From the water course the trail rises to a high point where it bends right (off the road) to run through the forest along a short single track portion. After 150 meters it re-joins the road.
      text_12: |
        In ~500 meters the trail enters into an open area of low trees. On the right is a large farm field (5 hectares) with a single small house in the middle.  The railroad tracks are 10 meters on the left.
      text_13: |
        This area is the former Estación Sanchez (Sanchez Station).  The tracks divide into two sets of tracks: a main track and secondary "lay by" track to permit priority trains to pass.  ~100 meters into this open area the trail bends sharply left to cross both sets of tracks. It follows between two rows of trees between the trail and the Divisadero highway.  The two sets of tracks are 10 meters in the right. Roughly half way along the length of the field the trail passes two small buildings and a fenced area.  After passing the small buildings the trail again passes between two rows of trees.  Camino markers are on the trees and fence posts.
      text_14: |
        The Camino then emerges into a small parking area on the west side of the Divisadero highway (27.716525, 107.678267, elevation 2442 meters).  Across the highway is the road to the community of Santa Elena (the road sigh to this community is on the highway before the parking area). The Santa Elena / Sanchez turn-off (on both sides of the highway) is also a stop for buses on the highway. Hikers wanting to take the bus in either direction are able to "flag down" the buses in these large open areas.  Alternatively, hikers wanting to walk back to Creel can turn left onto the highway at this point (slightly less than 6 km via the highway).  The west side of Highway 77 is the starting point for the following

      text: |
        This section of the trail returns to the pine forest to approach the railroad tracks and Highway 77.  It then follows the tracks and highway (sometimes 50 to 100 meters on the left, sometimes crossing the tracks and briefly adjoining the highway).  It passes through mixed forest and low brush to end at the inactive railroad stop at Estación Sanchez.  Across the highway on the east side is the turnoff to the pueblo of Santa Elena 2 kilometers from the highway.  The open area on both sides of the highway (used for bus stops) is 5+ kms from Creel via Highway 77.

        From the Sanchez / Elena bus stop and parking area, the trail crosses the railroad tracks onto a short section of rural road, turning a sharp left immediately after crossing the tracks.  The railroad is still a double set of tracks at this crossing.  In addition, the train sign for "Sanchez" is also visible on the east side of the tracks.
      text_02: |
        After crossing, in ~15 meters the trail turns sharp right and then immediately (5 meters) left onto a good rural road that the trail follows for the next 1.5 kms.  The railroad tracks are 10 - 15 meters on the left and generally visible.  Further to the left (east) is the Divisadero highway also running parallel to the railroad.  Hikers will also be able to hear the traffic from this highway.  On the right is the pine forest,
      text_03: |
        The trail descends slightly in the next 50 meters but immediately rises to return to the flat terrain at the same level as the tracks.  In ~300 meters there is a crossing with other unrelated roads, but the Camino continues straight on the rural road.  (The left road - which turns back more than 90 degrees - goes closer to the tracks.).  The railroad and the trail go south - southwest and straight for this entire section.  In certain portions of the trail it passes through the shade of the pines.  Markers are on trees and rocks in the road.
      text_04: |
        ~1.2 kms along the trail the vegetation thins somewhat.  The road comes to a fork, and the Camino takes the left path closer to the tracks.  The trail is smaller than the right fork that passes through a fence and continues to the right (farther from the tracks) along a fence. The Camino is to the left (closer to the tracks and on the east side) of this fence. The tracks are close to the trail (5 to 10 meters) and easily visible.
      text_05: |
        The path passes through scattered low brush. At ~1.5 kms the trail crosses the tracks (single set of tracks).  A small white cross (burial site) becomes visible.  It crosses through more low brush for another 50 meters before reaching the Divisadero highway. It crosses the highway into the Recowata road and parking area.
      text_06: |
        The Recowata turn-off (27.708892, 107.684341, elevation 2450 meters). is a large bare gravel area on the left (east) of the highway with large highway signs.  The Recowata road itself turns left off the highway in the middle of the gravel area.  A large blue sign indicates all the attractions along the road (viewpoint, baths.).  In addition, there is a distinctive large white "sculpture" with several vertical tubes cut on an angle. It is easily visible from the trail on the other (west) side of the highway.  Hikers continue from this area on to
      text_07: |
        Hikers wanting to return to Creel via the highway can turn left to walk the ~7 kms from Creel. There is a certain amount of tourist traffic on the Recowata road.  In light of the large off-highway area, hikers may also use buses to and from this point.
    overview:
      text: |
        The short section of the trail connects the Santa Elena / Estación Sanchez area with the unpaved road leading to the well-known Rukiraso waterfall and Recowata thermal baths (“aguas termales”). It generally follows a good rural road that parallels the railroad tracks (between 20 to 40 meters to the left of the Camino). Often the trail goes through the pine forest with both shady and sunny portions. As a consequence the road is generally flat with only two slight and gradual water course crossings. The total distance is ~ 1.5 km.

      Segment 3: From Santa Elena to Recowata Turn-off
  segment_4:
    description:
      text_01: |
        The trail starts on the south edge of the Recowata parking area, overlooking a large "balancing" boulder. From the parking lot it joins a road that descends slightly to the beginning of the cleared pipeline course.  The Divisadero highway is on the right less than 30 meters away. The trail goes up and down slightly for the next ~500 meters with markers painted on the numerous large rocks buried in the road or on the side.  After ~500 meters the path enters a small clearing near the highway, passing near a concrete valve box for the pipeline.
      text_02: |
        The trail continues through the clearing to a dirt road to the south west that descends sharply into a gully alongside the pipeline that is above ground at this point. The path bends to the right through the trees while the pipeline rises steeply above ground on the west (south) side of the gully. The trail climbs and bends back left toward the pipeline still visible. It then turns sharply right through very large boulders and climbs on a forest path toward the Divisadero highway. The highway remains only 30 meters to the right during this entire portion of the trail.
      text_03: |
        The path bends slightly left to avoid crossing the highway and climbs through the trees. At ~900 meters the path again enters a large clear area with another concrete valve box.  (27.702436, 107.688838, elevation 2480 meters).
      text_04: |
        After crossing the clear area (under the wires of the power transmission line), the Camino bends left and follows the cleared pipeline route above and along the highway.  At ~1.2 km the trail separates slightly from the pipeline and climbs a short hill through the trees to another clearing with somewhat restricted vistas of small canyons to the right. The highway remains 20 meters to the right.
      text_05: |
        From this highpoint the trail rejoins the pipeline course for its descent (slightly <1 km) to the crossing point of the pipeline and the highway.  The railroad also rejoins the highway (coming from the right) at the bottom of the hill.  The trail is on open ground as it drops alongside the highway on the right.  As the highway bends right (more to the west), the pipeline and trail also turn to the right.
      text_06: |
        50 meters before the pipeline crosses under the highway, the trail turns left off the wide pipeline course onto a narrow single track path in the trees that leads to a small stream course.  It makes a single switchback up the other side to join a rural road (turning left at the junction).  It continues 75 meters skirting the hill that the highway is climbing to the right.  After 75 meters the trail turns very sharply (more than 90 degrees) to the right and climbs steeply (up ~10 meters in 50 meters) to the point where it crosses the highway.  Care to follow the Camino markers may be necessary.
      text_07: |
        After crossing the highway, the trail turns to the left on a path through low trees to the top of the cleared area where the pipeline has also risen from its own crossing point below on the highway (27.694353, 107.695621, elevation 2451)). A 10 meter angled section of the red pipeline is clearly visible.  From the clear area the railroad is also visible below. There are also more distant views of tree-covered canyons to the east.  The upper level of the gravel pit is the starting point for the following
    overview:
      text_01: |
        This section of the Camino travels 2.5 kms from the turnoff to the Recowata thermal baths to the crossing of the Creel gas pipeline under the Divisadero highway.  It follows the buried course of the pipeline between Creel and the Pacific Coast ports (generally toward the southwest).  As of 2015, the area cleared for the burial of the pipeline had not regrown and was lined with dirt and rocks displaced during pipeline construction.  The course is wide (~8 meters) and easy to follow.  Any short sections of the Camino on smaller paths typically rejoin the pipeline course in ~100 meters.  Occasionally the pipeline itself (~ 30 centimeters in diameter and red in color) is visible above ground. The pipeline and the Camino remain near the Divisadero highway (varying up to 50 meters away) for the entire length of this section.  However, shortly after Recowata, the railroad turns more directly west and separates from the Highway.
      text_02: |
        The walking path is often over exposed rough rocky terrain with only low vegetation and few trees. However, there are also short sections within the pine forest (which is generally to the left of the trail) through large boulder fields. There are several water courses or gullies or rolling terrain to cross with a final descent of ~50 meters in the last 500 meters.

      text_01: |
        After leaving the cleared pipeline area, the trail again follows the course of the gas line up a small hill and then generally flat for 600 meters.  Trail markers often are painted on large rocks in the path.  At the start both the tracks (on the right) and the road (on the left) run near the trail in cut-out courses ~5 - 10 meters below the trail.  The railroad then bends farther away from the trail to the right (turning northwest).
      text_02: |
        At 600 meters the trail comes to the top of a hill and turns sharply to the right away from the pipeline. The highway is visible from this highpoint to the front, and there are views to the left over rolling barranca country.  After the sharp turn the trail turns back to the left, descending slightly through the trees.  It then climbs steeply (up 10 meters in 50 meters) a short hill through the forest.  From the hill top there are more views to the left from large boulders on the rim.
      text_03: |
        The trail crosses low vegetation to the left and joins a defined single track path through the woods, gradually descending and bending left. The path is through the pine and madrone forest.  After ~200 meters it bends gently to the right while continuing to descend.  The railroad is ~1/2 km to the right at this point.  As the trail approaches the dispersed community of El Ojito, there are a number of paths and roads connecting the Tarahumara families who often live near the rocks scattered throughout the area.  Care to follow the Camino markers (primarily on trees) may be necessary.
      text_04: |
        After ~1 km the trail reaches the bottom of the El Ojito valley the trail crosses the valley in sight of various farm fields along fences.  At the corner of one such farm (~150 meters into the valley), the trail turns right onto a rural road and climbs gradually along a network of rural roads to where it approaches the railroad (after 1/2 km).  The road is wide enough for vehicles and passes through the pine forest with frequent shady sections.  Care to follow the Camino markers on both trees and rocks may be necessary.
      text_05: |
        Near the close approach of the railroad (amid a large boulder field), a small field and Tarahumara dwellings are visible on the left.  The trail continues through the trees generally flat for 300 meters until leaving the road and bending right onto a narrow single track path through the forest.  Care to follow the Camino onto this narrow path may be necessary.  Within ~30 meters the path crosses a water course before continuing flat through the trees.  Another ~300 meters further on, the trail turns right onto a wider path / road and descends slightly while later bending left.
      text_06: |
        After ~250 meters the Divisadero highway becomes visible on the left.  In addition, the railroad is also getting closer to the trail from the right.  The trail leaves the road turning right onto a narrow path that passes through low bushes toward the highway as well as the railroad.
      text_07: |
        After ~100 meters the path crosses the railroad at the point where the tracks pass under the highway (a 10 meter high stone and steel bridge). (27.690123, 107.720119, elevation 2442 meters). It again passes through slow vegetation while gradually climbing ~10 meters in the trees along a defined path across a barbed wire fence.  ~100 meters past the fence the path bends left to merge with a rural road. The trail continues 150 meters along the road through the forest to the community of San Elias.​
      text_08: |
        San Elias is a small Tarahumara community with a number of buildings scattered across an open area of fields and houses.  It is just on the right (west) side of the Creel-Divisadero highway. The trail enters the village by turning right onto the highway access road next to a distinctive green and white 15 meter high water tower (27.687397, 107.724006, elevation 2453 meters).  Further along the access road is a small white church and many other buildings.
    overview:
      text: |
        This section of the Camino goes ~3 km southwest from the crossing point of the gas pipeline and the small community of San Elias.  Much of the trail is a pleasant walk through pine forest near the community of El Ojito located on the Creel-Divisadero highway.  The trail lies between the highway (east) and the railroad (west).  Although often not in sight of the highway or railroad, it is sufficiently near that train and road traffic can be heard.  A highlight of the section is crossing the railroad at the point where the railroad itself crosses under the Highway 77 bridge.

        From the water tower as the trail enters San Elias,, the Camino takes a left fork off the access road and continues past several school buildings on the right. Then it turns left on a village road through a gate into a more open farming and residential area on both left and right.
      text_02: |
        After 250 meters the road passes through another gate and further through the trees to another clearing with several houses.  Immediately before the clear area, the trail turns sharply left on a track road that descends gradually toward the highway, ending only 10 meters away and then then turning parallel to it, crossing under a barbed wire fence.  The vegetation in this portion is low scattered bushes. The trail climbs slowly into some trees until reaching a small clearing on the side of the highway. This is the crossing point to the east side of Highway 77. (27.681117, 107.723681, elevation 2448 meters)
      text_03: |
        ​​At the clearing the trail turns sharply left to cross the highway and enters the pine forest.  It climbs through the trees bending right to the top of the small hill.  From the top there are views over the El Cajon canyon to the west and over other Tarahumara houses of the San Elias community to the east.  The trail goes to the left of the hill summit across a low barbed wire fence and then down steeply (and right) through open low brush vegetation.  At the bottom of the descent (and then to the left) there is an open gate.  The trail goes through the gate and once again descends steeply for 30 meters across an open clearing.  The trail passes through the clearing and then climbs abruptly to the start of the old high road from Creel to Divisadero.  The Camino is the road that climbs  on the right up from the open area. (27.679138, 107.721080, elevation 2439 meters)

        This short (slightly >1 km) section connects the pueblo of San Elias with the turn-off to the old high road from Creel to Divisadero.  It generally follows the route of the current highway.  By contrast, the railroad (which the trail crossed in the prior section 5) has turned to the east to avoid the El Cajon canyon and is increasingly distant from the trail for the next ~5 kms.

      Segment 6: From San Elias to the Old High Road
  segment_7:
    description:
      text_01: |
        The Camino starts at the turnoff of the old high road ~13 kms south of Creel.  The old road climbs moderately just to the left of the highway with the pine forest on its left.  Another road providing access to the nearby electrical power line also climbs at 90 degree from this same point.  Care to take the Camino (and not the steep road) may be necessary.  The transmission line is visible through the trees (50 meters to the left) at this point, roughly parallel to the trail..
      text_02: |
        The old road is the wide, rough, rocky rural road up to 8 meters wide with no vegetation.  It also is the course for a water pipeline (and the pipeline itself and its related valve boxes are sometimes visible).  The modern highway is visible to the right behind the trees as it drops into the Cajon canyon.  (After this point the highway is not visible from the trail until the very end of this section.).  The trail climbs ~40 meters in ~300 meters before leveling out.   At this flattening point there is another road on the left that leads to the radio tower visible above the trail on the left.  The level (very gentle ascent) section bends slowly to the right above a tree-lined bowl to a "saddle" ~1.5 kms from the start with views to the west over distant barrancas.  (27.669453, 107.714405, elevation 2509 meters).  This is the highest location on the Camino between Creel and this point.
      text_03: |
        From the saddle the trail resumes its gentle climb past a green and white Chihuahua State water tower.  From this tower the trail and road coincide with the course of the water pipeline.  Past the tower the road begins a slow descent to a "hairpin" turn where it drops more sharply for ~300 meters.  After leveling out along a stream bed with forest on both sides (another 400 meters), the trail crosses the Chepe railroad as it passes through the Sierra. (27.654535, 107.722976, elevation 2379 meters.)
      text_04: |
        Past the railroad crossing the trail climbs moderately while bending to the right. Near the top of this ascent another road forks to the left. (27.654545, 107.744697, elevation 2403 meters.)  The Camino, however, is the right fork that descends more steeply for 200 meters. To the left on the far side of the barranca is the railroad which makes a hairpin turn in a side canyon.  The trail also makes a sharp hairpin turn to the left.  It descends - at first steeply, then more gently - along a stream with pine and madrone forest on both sides.  At this point the trail runs roughly parallel to the railroad on the right and ~40 meters below the railroad.  After ~1 km of pleasant hiking in this arroyo through the trees and along the stream bed, distinctive "pinnacle" type rock formations become visible along the arroyo walls on both sides of the trail.
      text_05: |
        The road comes to a sharp left turn (27.653692, 107.735294, elevation 2248 meters).  It begins a series of curves or switchbacks as it climbs uphill toward the railroad above.  The road is rough and rocky on this ascent.  The arroyo with its rock formations gradually becomes more visible from above behind the trail as it climbs.  As the trail approaches very close to the tracks (after ~500 meters), the wider road (or trail) turns sharply to the right onto a narrower trail (27.651403, 107.737028, elevation 2285 meters ).  Care to be sure to make this turn - that is difficult to identify - may be necessary.
      text_06: |
        In ~20 meters the trail crosses the railroad tracks.  (As evident later, this section of the tracks is on the lower portion of the 360 degree "loop" made by the train.).  It climbs moderately through low brush on a rough surface to the top of the hill. There are outstanding views of the distant Barranca del Cobre to the south from this climb section.  After the section of open views, the trail enters a more vegetated section until it crosses the upper railroad tracks as it proceeds toward the crossing of the loop.   The trail flattens as it reaches the hill top in the pine forest. At the summit there is an intersection with another road turning sharply right (27.655126, 107.739437, elevation 2335 meters).
      text_07: |
        At this intersection the Camino goes straight ahead. However, the right turn is a side trip to the railroad bridge where the Chepe train "crosses itself" as it climbs higher into the Sierra.  Due to elevation change and limits on the climbing rate of the train, the railroad must make a 360 degree "loop" where the train actually crosses its own route. The lower portion passes through a short tunnel under the higher portion as the tracks continue upward into the Sierra. The side trip goes ~250 meters directly to the tunnel and bridge. (27.656037, 107.737357, elevation 2333 meters)   It then returns to the Camino on the same path.  Single green markers indicate the trail (no red markers).
      text_08: |
        From the hilltop intersection the trail descends moderately on a curving path to cross the higher portion of the tracks once again. (27.654826, 107.740867, elevation 2317 meters ) There are good views to the south and west. Immediately after the upper crossing, the trail turns left and then sharply right into a hairpin. It drops moderately toward the lower tracks of the railroad visible below to the left. After ~500 meters of descent through mixed forest, the road forks with the Camino continuing on the right fork. Care to make this turn may be appropriate.
      text_09: |
        The right fork road also continues descending with the tracks remaining on the left (varying distances up to 50 meters). The tracks and trails bend gradually left (southwest) for the final 500 meters of this Section 7.  The trail is on rolling terrain through mixed forest and brush. This section of the trail ends as it intersects the modern Creel-Divisadero highway.  This intersection occurs precisely at the crossing of the railroad and the highway.  There are speed bumps of the crossing, slowing all motor vehicles as they approach the tracks.
      text_10: |
        There is a large open area on the southwest side (across from the end of the Section 7 trail).  This clear area is ~20 kms from Creel.  It may be a suitable area for hikers to use buses for access.
    overview:
      text: |
        This section of ~9 kilometers uses the old high road between Creel and Divisadero to avoid the steep descent into El Cajon canyon (200 meters deep and 6 km long) taken by the paved highway.  It also follows the course of a water pipeline for a substantial distance, only separating for the final portion.  In contrast to Highway 77, the first part of the old road remains relatively high as it traverses this part of the Sierra offering views over the canyons in the distance.  The middle part drops down to the railroad and follows stream beds in the forest, only climbing back to the ridge / mesa in the final 2.5 kms.  A highlight possible from the Camino - not on the Camino itself but as a side trip - is to see the point on the railroad where the train makes a 360 degree "loop" in its climb and passes / under (depending on direction) over its own route.

        As of 2015 the entire marked Camino extends from Creel 20 kms (by highway) to the railroad crossing somewhat north of the pueblo of Pitorreal.  The trail itself is somewhat longer (~25 kms) due to its turns and curves.  Some hikers in good physical condition may choose to walk the entire distance in a single day.  Others may choose shorter sections along this path as preferred, depending on physical condition, the difficulty of the trail, or other factors.  The Camino will be enjoyable in any way.
      text_02: |
        However, understanding the characteristics of each segment suggests certain suggested routes that may appeal to more hikers than others.  In general, these suggestions can be experienced in either direction, e.g., from Creel  (and returning by bus) or to Creel (after taking a bus to the trailhead).  In some cases several of the suggested hikes can be connected together for a longer experience.

        This hike of ~7.5 kms (one way) enables the hiker to quickly get into the pine forest surrounding Creel with nice views over the town itself.  It also passes through nice sections in the trees over easy rolling terrain.  It is very close to the railroad and highway for ~ 1 / 2 of the path.  Santa Elena is an official bus stop for the Rápidos Cauhtémoc bus company.

        This hike of ~11 kms (one way) starts in the nice pueblo of San Elias where it may be possible to get an impression of local Tarahumara life.  San Elias is an official bus stop for the Rápidos Cauhtémoc bus company.
      text_02: |
        It also features several locations with nice views over barranca country to the west and south.  It is very easy to follow for most of its length since it follows the wide old road and a pipeline.  Roughly 2.5 kms from the south end, the trail offers a 250 meter side trip to the 360 degree ”loop” of the train as it crosses over itself on its path up the Sierra.
      text_03: |
        On the other hand, from its high point, the trail descends into an arroyo.  This arroyo trail is pleasant with views of typical Barrancas country rock formations.  However, the arroyo portion requires a short but demanding climb over a final hill before ending at the railroad crossing.

        There is a nice~2.5 km walk traveling north toward Creel in the forest in Segment 5.  Soon after leaving San Elias going north toward Creel, hikers come to the location where the Camino crosses the railroad precisely at the point where it passes under Highway 77.  There is a impressive bridge at this point. Thereafter, the trail transitions to a wide rural road through more open forest.  Then, after passing through a small valley (El Ojito) with farm fields, the trail climbs gently to a pleasant shady single-track path in the trees on soft pine needle footing with views to the east.  At the end of the forest hikers can leave the Camino and walk to the nearby highway to catch a vehicle onward.

      The vision of the Camino del Cobre (The Copper Canyon Trail) is to create a unique experience for visitors to Copper Canyon with a hike along the rim of the canyon, experiencing the beauty of its vistas, the wonders of the local indigenous culture, and its colonial history.  In the tradition of the famous trails of Europe and America - like the Santiago Trail in Spain - the Camino will be a trail of hundreds of miles = from the Basaseachic Waterfall to Sinforosa Canyon, the deepest of all.  Following the Camino's trail signs, hikers will be able to create their own routes of 1, 2 or more days depending on their own preference - starting out in the eco-tourist center of Creel and using the trail network to visit nearby Raramuri (Tarahumara) villages or historic sites from the heyday of Mexican silver mining or the many natural wonders of the region.  As the same time they can enjoy the knowledge that their visit is making a contribution to the economic well-being of the Tarahumara region, one of the most interesting but poorest regions in all Mexico.
