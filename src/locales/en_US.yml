    intro: |
      The following trail guide is designed to enable hikers to complete a ~25 kilometer (16 miles) hike connecting Creel and the Barranca del Cobre rim at Divisadero.  It currently stops at the crossing of the paved highway (Mexico 77) with the railroad ~20 kilometers south via the highway.  There are other shorter segments possible as well.

        1. The guide is written from the perspective of a hiker leaving the train station in Creel traveling south.  However, the trail itself is designed to accommodate hikers walking in the northward direction (e.g., toward Creel) as well.  Trail markers are intentionally visible from both directions.  However, the Guide takes off from Creel as the center of tourism for the region and the primary terminus for the Chepe tourist train.  Hikers traveling north should be able to follow the path “in reverse:” e.g., “turn left” becomes “turn right,” “after the fork” becomes “before the fork,” etc.

        2. The text Guide includes GPS waypoints (longitude, latitude, and elevation) that indicate important locations on the trail, such as key turns, landmarks, crossing points, or section endpoints,
      text_3: |
        3. To complement the text trail description, the Guide also includes a table of waypoints and a map depiction of those waypoints (Google Maps).  With the right GPS devices, hikers can track the path and confirm their location on the Camino using the way points if they want.
      text_4: |
        4. As appropriate, the Guide also includes photos of key turns, views, villages, markers, and other aspects of walking the Camino. 
      text_5: |
        5. The Guide is divided into Segments 1 to 7.  They vary in length from approximately 1 to 9 kilometerss, reflecting the exact location of places where hikers can access the Divisadero Highway for bus or other motor transport.  For hikers in good physical condition the entire 25 kilometer (16 miles) is possible in a single long day excursion.

    overview: |
      The Camino del Cobre (The Copper Canyon Trail) will be a long-distance trail that highlights the tourist wonders of the Copper Canyon region - nature, culture, history, and the opportunity for personal challenge.  Extending from the northern waterfalls to great southern canyons, the Trail will follow the rim of the world's largest canyon system - with chances to visit local villages and historical sites. When completed, the Trail will span a number of days in  its entirety.  Now hikers can follow the trail markers for their own route of 1,2 or more days, starting in the eco-tourist center of Creel, Chihuahua, Mexico.

      text: |
        The Camino del Cobre is still in the very early stages of its development.  It still faces many challenges.. It will benefit significantly from the participation of any individual or organization committed to the benefit of the Copper Canyon and the Tarahumara people and willing to devote their energy to helping build the trail and its impact in the region.

      text_1: |
        The High Country region between Creel and the rim (Divisadero) is generally rugged, rolling terrain lying between 2,100 to 2,400 meters (roughly 7000 and 8000 feet) in elevation.  In many cases the terrain is that of a ”mesa” (Spanish for “table”) and quite flat for many kilometers.  However, there are also many arroyos (small canyons carved by water) cutting across the mesa.  However, the elevation change between the top of the mesa and the bottom is generally less than 200 meters.
      text_2: |
        Close to Creel views are primarily those of forested ridges and arroyos.  Further south, the vistas widen out to the barrancas and river canyons.
      text_3: |
        The region is well forested primarily with Ponderosa pine.  There are also stands of coniferous cedars and junipers and deciduous trees such as oak and madrone (a low, distinctively red-barked tree).  However, despite the presence of the many water courses, there is little water on the surface except during the rainy season.

        The High Country
    route:
      text_1: |
        Due to the rugged and undeveloped terrain of the Creel region, the Camino generally follows the Chepe railroad route southward toward Divisadero.  By its nature, the railroad cannot climb or descend rapidly.  Its tracks are limited to a 3% grade.  This route enables hikers generally to avoid steep elevation changes associated with simply going cross-country on a direct line.  Instead, the Camino follows a gently rolling, often flat path, despite the rough country around it.
      text_2: |
        In addition, the trail also follows the modern Creel-to-Divisadero highway (Mexico 77).  This paved highway often is also very close to the railroad line.  In many areas the Camino path is very close to either the highway or the tracks (as close as 5 meters).   In most cases hikers are within easy hearing range of highway vehicles or the trains.  However, at no time, does the Camino trail overlap directly with either the highway or the tracks.  In limited cases, of course, the trail separates at greater distance from the two modern routes (up to several kilometers in the El Cajón canyon area).
      text_3: |
        In certain locations, the Camino also follows the course of pipelines carrying water and natural gas between Creel and certain rim villages (Divisadero, Arepanoguchi, San Rafael).  The pipeline course is also close to the highway (primarily) and railroad tracks.  These sections are somewhat more “up and down” than those nearer the railroad.  However, the pipelines also tend to avoid the extremely steep changes possible in such rugged country.
      text_4: |
        By taking advantage of these existing routes, the Camino generally offers comfortable walking in rolling terrain without the extra-rigorous demands of a high-altitude (8000 ft) hike.  In addition to this physical aspect, the proximity of the road (and railroad) offers hikers the security of knowing that there are alternative ways to return to developed areas, if they want to stop or if they face a medical or other emergency.

      Region and route
    trail:
      text_1: |
        The Tarahumara living the Barrancas are historically well-known for their tireless walking and running.  As a result there have always been many forest paths that cover the Creel-to-Divisadero region connecting ranchos, roads, fields, and pueblos.   In addition, as Mexico has developed in recent years, there is also an extensive network of rough rural roads for motor vehicles (typically 4 wheel pickups) used by the locals for longer trips.  Close to Creel itself, there are also designated hiking, biking, and ATV trails, occasionally marked with arrow or other trail markers.
      text_2: |
        The Camino largely takes advantage of previous paths and roads used by the Tarahumara and other local residents.  It often goes by farm fields and isolated houses.  It often selects the paths best suited for hikers, rather than just for more practical purpose (such as choosing a more scenic path, rather than the most direct).  Depending on what is available in any specific area, the Camino uses rural roads, narrow single-track paths through the woods, the wide open course of pipelines, ATV or mountain bike tracks, and an occasional cross country “bush whack” with clear markers on trees.   It then connects these disparate paths into an overall path connecting important points on the way.  The hiker could easily start on a wide rural road, transition to a narrow path through the trees for a short time, then switch to a pipeline course, and back to a forest path.

        The Trail of Trails
  vision:
    text: |
      The vision of the Camino del Cobre (The Copper Canyon Trail) is to create a unique experience for visitors to Copper Canyon with a hike along the rim of the canyon, experiencing the beauty of its vistas, the wonders of the local indigenous culture, and its colonial history.  In the tradition of the famous trails of Europe and America - like the Santiago Trail in Spain - the Camino will be a trail of hundreds of miles = from the Basaseachic Waterfall to Sinforosa Canyon, the deepest of all.  Following the Camino's trail signs, hikers will be able to create their own routes of 1, 2 or more days depending on their own preference - starting out in the eco-tourist center of Creel and using the trail network to visit nearby Raramuri (Tarahumara) villages or historic sites from the heyday of Mexican silver mining or the many natural wonders of the region.  As the same time they can enjoy the knowledge that their visit is making a contribution to the economic well-being of the Tarahumara region, one of the most interesting but poorest regions in all Mexico.
