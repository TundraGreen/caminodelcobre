        The Camino is still in its early phase of development.  In the future it will extend from the northern barrancas with their scenic waterfalls, along the canyon rims, and ultimately to the deep canyons and the intensely Tarahumara culture of the south.  At this time, however, the Camino is focused in the tourist center of Creel.
      text_2: |
        The principal station on the famous Chihuahua Pacific ("Chepe") railroad line through the Copper Canyon region, Creel is in the middle of the entire Barrancas del Cobre area.  It offers good access to explore both north and south from the rim to the High Country.  It has well-developed facilities and experienced individuals to provide outstanding recreation in biking, horseback riding, adventuring, hiking, 4 wheelers, and guided touring.  For this reason the initial section of the Camino starts in Creel with the final destination of the famous vistas of Divisadero.   In later years additional sections will be gradually added to the Camino to complete its long-distance vision.

        The Camino is intended to be enjoyed in smaller parts (like other famous Trails), rather than in a single long effort.  The initial part begins in Creel and extends toward the rim vistas of ​Divisadero in segments of varying lengths, depending on the hiker’s preference and ability.  The first segments available in 2015 go 25 kilometers via the trail (20 kilometers via the Creel-Divisadero highway) toward the barrancas near Divisadero.  With a number of convenient places to stop and return to Creel by vehicle (or the Chepe train), the trail offers a good opportunity to enjoy the High Country pine forest with views of the distant barrancas.

        1. The guide is written from the perspective of a hiker leaving the train station in Creel traveling south.  However, the trail itself is designed to accommodate hikers walking in the northward direction (e.g., toward Creel) as well.  Trail markers are intentionally visible from both directions.  However, the Guide takes off from Creel as the center of tourism for the region and the primary terminus for the Chepe tourist train.  Hikers traveling north should be able to follow the path “in reverse:” e.g., “turn left” becomes “turn right,” “after the fork” becomes “before the fork,” etc.

        5. The Guide is divided into Segments 1 to 7.  They vary in length from approximately 1 to 9 kilometerss, reflecting the exact location of places where hikers can access the Divisadero Highway for bus or other motor transport.  For hikers in good physical condition the entire 25 kilometer (16 miles) is possible in a single long day excursion.

    overview: |
      The Camino del Cobre (The Copper Canyon Trail) will be a long-distance trail that highlights the tourist wonders of the Copper Canyon region - nature, culture, history, and the opportunity for personal challenge.  Extending from the northern waterfalls to great southern canyons, the Trail will follow the rim of the world's largest canyon system - with chances to visit local villages and historical sites. When completed, the Trail will span a number of days in  its entirety.  Now hikers can follow the trail markers for their own route of 1,2 or more days, starting in the eco-tourist center of Creel, Chihuahua, Mexico.

      text: |
        The Camino del Cobre is still in the very early stages of its development.  It still faces many challenges.. It will benefit significantly from the participation of any individual or organization committed to the benefit of the Copper Canyon and the Tarahumara people and willing to devote their energy to helping build the trail and its impact in the region.

      text_1: |
        The High Country region between Creel and the rim (Divisadero) is generally rugged, rolling terrain lying between 2,100 to 2,400 meters (roughly 7000 and 8000 feet) in elevation.  In many cases the terrain is that of a ”mesa” (Spanish for “table”) and quite flat for many kilometers.  However, there are also many arroyos (small canyons carved by water) cutting across the mesa.  However, the elevation change between the top of the mesa and the bottom is generally less than 200 meters.
      text_2: |
        Close to Creel views are primarily those of forested ridges and arroyos.  Further south, the vistas widen out to the barrancas and river canyons.
      text_3: |
        The region is well forested primarily with Ponderosa pine.  There are also stands of coniferous cedars and junipers and deciduous trees such as oak and madrone (a low, distinctively red-barked tree).  However, despite the presence of the many water courses, there is little water on the surface except during the rainy season.
      title: |
        The High Country
    route:
      text_1: |
        Due to the rugged and undeveloped terrain of the Creel region, the Camino generally follows the Chepe railroad route southward toward Divisadero.  By its nature, the railroad cannot climb or descend rapidly.  Its tracks are limited to a 3% grade.  This route enables hikers generally to avoid steep elevation changes associated with simply going cross-country on a direct line.  Instead, the Camino follows a gently rolling, often flat path, despite the rough country around it.
      text_2: |
        In addition, the trail also follows the modern Creel-to-Divisadero highway (Mexico 77).  This paved highway often is also very close to the railroad line.  In many areas the Camino path is very close to either the highway or the tracks (as close as 5 meters).   In most cases hikers are within easy hearing range of highway vehicles or the trains.  However, at no time, does the Camino trail overlap directly with either the highway or the tracks.  In limited cases, of course, the trail separates at greater distance from the two modern routes (up to several kilometers in the El Cajón canyon area).
      text_3: |
        In certain locations, the Camino also follows the course of pipelines carrying water and natural gas between Creel and certain rim villages (Divisadero, Arepanoguchi, San Rafael).  The pipeline course is also close to the highway (primarily) and railroad tracks.  These sections are somewhat more “up and down” than those nearer the railroad.  However, the pipelines also tend to avoid the extremely steep changes possible in such rugged country.
      text_4: |
        By taking advantage of these existing routes, the Camino generally offers comfortable walking in rolling terrain without the extra-rigorous demands of a high-altitude (8000 ft) hike.  In addition to this physical aspect, the proximity of the road (and railroad) offers hikers the security of knowing that there are alternative ways to return to developed areas, if they want to stop or if they face a medical or other emergency.

        The Route

      Region and route
    trail:
      text_1: |
        The Tarahumara living the Barrancas are historically well-known for their tireless walking and running.  As a result there have always been many forest paths that cover the Creel-to-Divisadero region connecting ranchos, roads, fields, and pueblos.   In addition, as Mexico has developed in recent years, there is also an extensive network of rough rural roads for motor vehicles (typically 4 wheel pickups) used by the locals for longer trips.  Close to Creel itself, there are also designated hiking, biking, and ATV trails, occasionally marked with arrow or other trail markers.
      text_2: |
        The Camino largely takes advantage of previous paths and roads used by the Tarahumara and other local residents.  It often goes by farm fields and isolated houses.  It often selects the paths best suited for hikers, rather than just for more practical purpose (such as choosing a more scenic path, rather than the most direct).  Depending on what is available in any specific area, the Camino uses rural roads, narrow single-track paths through the woods, the wide open course of pipelines, ATV or mountain bike tracks, and an occasional cross country “bush whack” with clear markers on trees.   It then connects these disparate paths into an overall path connecting important points on the way.  The hiker could easily start on a wide rural road, transition to a narrow path through the trees for a short time, then switch to a pipeline course, and back to a forest path.

        The trail heads south (in the direction marked toward Los Mochis indicated on the train station), starting immediately after leaving the station (27.75438, 107.634893, elevation 2340 m),
      text_02: |
        A green and red trail marker is painted on the rock wall opposite the station across the tracks. There is similar green and red trail signage painted on the wall going south from the station and later on posts and buildings through the rail yard.  There is a concrete sidewalk on the east side of the tracks for 200 meters from the station past the central plaza.
      text_03: |
        After the town center, several unpaved paths run parallel to the main tracks.  The most suitable trail varies from one side of the tracks to another, and hikers can choose their preferred path.  The tracks themselves also vary between single tracks and double tracks for 300 meters until a “rail yard” widens out with multiple tracks, returning to a single track at ~600 meters.
      text_04: |
        ~750 meters south of the station, the trail bends to the west (right) and passes under a white highway bridge for the principal highway into Creel (Mexico 77). (27.743488, 107.643543, elevation 2340 m).
      text_05: |
        It continues another 300 meters along a road that parallels the railroad tracks with houses and small shops.  It then crosses the tracks next to the large rocks of the mesa and bends left along the tracks as they make a large turn to the left (south).  For ~100 meters the trail is 5 meters below the tracks.  Midway along the turn of the tracks the trail turns hard right (west) along an unpaved rural road.  On the right are farms fields and pastures with houses several hundred meters from the trail. The trail is on the south side of a flat farming valley ~1 km long.  (The Lion Caves (Cuevas de los Leones) is on the north side along a side road,) ~150 meters after the right turn the trail forks left (crossing a small waters course) and climbs gradually on the south side past more rural homes.  
        
      text_06: |
        As of 2015, there is an unfinished adobe house on the right side of the trail as it begins its climb on the left. (27.742904, 107.647314, elevation 2340 m).
      text_07: |
        After ~100 meters the trail enters the trees as it climbs to the top of the mesa above Creel.  There are views to the right (north) over the valley and mesas.  Following a series of forest paths and switchbacks the trail reaches the top of the mesa after 20 minutes.  The trail emerges from the trees to turn right (west northwest) onto a rural road that runs above the rural valley.  The trail is generally flat with trees on the right above the escarpment and mixed fields and trees on the left.  The trail passes through open woods terrain with trail markers on trees, rocks in the road, and on large boulders next to the road.   The direction is generally west northwest.  In this section there are many rural roads and smaller paths in all directions.  Attention to stay on the right trail may be necessary.
      text_08: |
        After ~1.5 km in open forest the trail turns more to the west and enters denser woodlands, sometimes following fence lines enclosing farm fields on the left.  ~3 km from Creel (40 minutes), after crossing a small water course, the trail turns sharply to the west.  It follows rural roads and fence lines with farm fields (sometimes with farm houses and animals and local Tarahumara farmers) on the left.
      text_09: |
        In this section there are also many small paths and roads that cross or run parallel to the trail.  After ~1 kms the trail turns hard to the right from a road onto a forest path that descends gradually and crosses another small water course. It climbs gradually through open forest until it meets a farm field on the left and follows the fence line until turning left (again along fence line) for 200 meters.
      text_10: |
        On the right large rock formations and a bare gravel pit are visible 100+ meters from the trail. There are many cris-crossing paths in this area. The pit is ~3.5 kms from Creel via the trail.  On the far (west) side of the pit (~200 meters from the trail) is the old road from Creel to Divisadero.  Hikers wanting to return to Creel have the option of crossing the pit, turning right on the old road, and walking back to town.
      text_11: |
        Midway along the fence line the trail bends slightly to the right into the trees (remaining to the east of the gravel pit).  It descends slightly into a water course, rising on the other side to pass through a rural gate and 20 meters beyond into a large field at its northwest corner. The trail passes 100 meters in the west side if the field next to dense woods on the right.  A second mesa climbs steeply in the right. At the southwest corner it passes through another rural gate and turns sharply right (west).  After ~100 meters the trails climbs steeply (~40 meter gain in 400 meters) to the top of the second mesa.  The area is heavily forested in pine with madrone (red barked broad-leaf tree).  After reaching the top of the mesa the trail bends gently to the right until reaching the old road from Creel to Divisadero (unpaved and rough).
      text_12: |
        Hikers wanting to return to Creel at this point can turn right onto the old road and walk along it for ~5 kms.  However, the Camino turns left at this junction and continues to

        This section takes hikers from the Creel train station into the forest outside of town.  After passing through a residential area to the south, it separates from the railroad tracks and climbs into the forest on the mesas surrounding the town.  Once on the mesa, it passes through a mixture of farm fields and forest, sometimes on a rural road and sometimes on a single-track forest path.  After a second climb up another mesa, it ends at the old road between Creel and Divisadero ~4 km from Creel.
    title: |
      Segment 1: From Creel to the Old Road
  segment_2:
    description:
      text_01: |
        The trail starts at the intersection of the trail and the old unpaved road to Divisadero. The trail turns sharply left onto a side road that runs parallel 5 meters east (left) of the old road. The trail markers follow the fence posts for ~50 meters until reaching a barbed wire gate on the left.
      text_02: |
        The trail turns sharply left (east) through the gate onto a road leading past several Tarahumara houses on right (and left farther away).  It follows the road (not entering the driveways to the farm dwellings) passing the fence of a small field on the right.  At the end of the fence it turns sharp right, then quickly sharp left.  In 75 meters the trail goes through another pole gate.
      text_03: |
        From the gate the trail follows a rural road skirting a low hill on the left for ~ 1.0 km through the pine forest. There are occasional side roads to the right leading away from the hill (for example, ~1/2 km past the gate).  ~750 meters past the gate the forest opens up with fewer trees and more low brush and bushes.  The trail bends right off the road to a single track path. Close attention to the trail markers posted on trees and on rocks in the road may be necessary,
      text_04: |
        ~1.25 km the trail passes into high open brush land with views of Creel on the left.  It curves gently to the right (south and then west) and descends slightly (5 - 10 meters) until meeting a trail coming from the left.  From this intersection the railroad line is visible directly in front ~ 20 meters.  The trail bends right and follows a defined single track trail through the trees gradually getting closer to the railroad tracks.  In ~100 meters the paved highway to Divisadero also becomes visible on the left 15 meters on the other side of the tracks.  At this point the trail is very close to both the tracks and the road.  The turn-off to the new Creel airport is on the opposite side of the highway.  For hikers wanting to return to Creel it is possible to cross the tracks at this Point, turn left (north and down the hill) onto the highway, and follow it ~3 kms to town.
      text_05: |
        The trail continues from this point on a defined single track parallel to the tracks.  It gradually climbs into the forest (somewhat to the right) increasing its distance from the tracks (up to 50 meters).  ~200 meters from the possible track crossing the trail leaves the trees and crosses a small rocky area with the trail indicated on the rocks.  It resumes its course west through the pine forest.  In some areas the single track path is also marked with "blazes" (small areas on the tree where the bark has been removed).
      text_06: |
        After ~1 km the trail bends left and crosses the railroad tracks.  It then bends slightly right and descends in 75 meters to a small parking area on the west side of the highway,  The railroad continues higher on the slope and further away from the trail.  Hikers wanting to return to Creel can turn left on the highway (north and up the hill) at this point (~3.5 kms to town via the highway).
      text_07: |
        The trail directly crosses the parking area (20 meters), following markers painted on rocks in the open area.  It follows a rough rural road and descends slightly through the trees crossing a small water course.  The road / trail climbs slightly through the trees alongside a field and fence.  On the left an open area of scattered bushes and low trees is visible beneath the turn of the highway (< 50 meters away).   ~30 meters from the water course the trail turns sharply left away from the fence onto a defined single track path through more scattered low bushes.  It curves to the left back toward the road through trees.  After ~75 meters the trail meets the highway but turns sharply right on a defined path ascending away from the road.  In ~75 meters the trail crosses the railroad tracks (which has once again rejoined the trail) and again enters into the pine forest.
      text_08: |
        From this crossing the trail continues south-south west parallel to the tracks (generally visible and <50 meters) on the left. The highway is also running parallel on the other side of the tracks (another ~25 meters away).  The path is generally flat or gently rolling as it crosses a small water course.  In some cases trees also have "blazes" aa well as Camino markers.  In some areas the vegetation is manzanita or other low brush.  In ~1 km the trail again approaches closer to the tracks and passes through broken trees and brush.
      text_09: |
        The trail emerges from the low forest and crosses the old unpaved road from Creel to Divisadero.  In another ~20 meters the old road also crosses the railroad tracks (complete with an X-type railroad crossing sign) and meets the modern paved highway.  This crossing and junction is easily visible from the trail on the left.  Hikers wanting to return to Creel may turn left at the crossing onto the road and return (~4.5 kms via the highway).
      text_10: |
        This crossing is a network of roads leading to various destinations in the area.  Care to follow the Camino markers (often on rocks) may be necessary.  After crossing the old road the trail descends on a short rural road slightly for ~15 meters to a 4-way junction with a rural road crossing the Camino. The Camino is the straight alternative (e.g., parallel with the tracks) descending to a small water course.  From this point the trail generally follows a rural road that runs parallel to the tracks (~20 meters to the left) for ~1 km to the end of the section.  It is generally open and free from vegetation.  The pine forest is on the right.
      text_11: |
        From the water course the trail rises to a high point where it bends right (off the road) to run through the forest along a short single track portion. After 150 meters it re-joins the road.
      text_12: |
        In ~500 meters the trail enters into an open area of low trees. On the right is a large farm field (5 hectares) with a single small house in the middle.  The railroad tracks are 10 meters on the left.
      text_13: |
        This area is the former Estación Sanchez (Sanchez Station).  The tracks divide into two sets of tracks: a main track and secondary "lay by" track to permit priority trains to pass.  ~100 meters into this open area the trail bends sharply left to cross both sets of tracks. It follows between two rows of trees between the trail and the Divisadero highway.  The two sets of tracks are 10 meters in the right. Roughly half way along the length of the field the trail passes two small buildings and a fenced area.  After passing the small buildings the trail again passes between two rows of trees.  Camino markers are on the trees and fence posts.
      text_14: |
        The Camino then emerges into a small parking area on the west side of the Divisadero highway (27.716525, 107.678267, elevation 2442 meters).  Across the highway is the road to the community of Santa Elena (the road sigh to this community is on the highway before the parking area). The Santa Elena / Sanchez turn-off (on both sides of the highway) is also a stop for buses on the highway. Hikers wanting to take the bus in either direction are able to "flag down" the buses in these large open areas.  Alternatively, hikers wanting to walk back to Creel can turn left onto the highway at this point (slightly less than 6 km via the highway).  The west side of Highway 77 is the starting point for the following
    overview:
      text: |
        This section of the trail returns to the pine forest to approach the railroad tracks and Highway 77.  It then follows the tracks and highway (sometimes 50 to 100 meters on the left, sometimes crossing the tracks and briefly adjoining the highway).  It passes through mixed forest and low brush to end at the inactive railroad stop at Estación Sanchez.  Across the highway on the east side is the turnoff to the pueblo of Santa Elena 2 kilometers from the highway.  The open area on both sides of the highway (used for bus stops) is 5+ kms from Creel via Highway 77.

    text: |
      The vision of the Camino del Cobre (The Copper Canyon Trail) is to create a unique experience for visitors to Copper Canyon with a hike along the rim of the canyon, experiencing the beauty of its vistas, the wonders of the local indigenous culture, and its colonial history.  In the tradition of the famous trails of Europe and America - like the Santiago Trail in Spain - the Camino will be a trail of hundreds of miles = from the Basaseachic Waterfall to Sinforosa Canyon, the deepest of all.  Following the Camino's trail signs, hikers will be able to create their own routes of 1, 2 or more days depending on their own preference - starting out in the eco-tourist center of Creel and using the trail network to visit nearby Raramuri (Tarahumara) villages or historic sites from the heyday of Mexican silver mining or the many natural wonders of the region.  As the same time they can enjoy the knowledge that their visit is making a contribution to the economic well-being of the Tarahumara region, one of the most interesting but poorest regions in all Mexico.
